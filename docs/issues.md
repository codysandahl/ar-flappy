# Issue Tracker

- Add visual frame to show the tracker boundary
- Add health indicator to player
- Handle collisions with diagonal platforms since AABB becomes distorted and useless in that case
- Have death animation for player
- Stop game and offer to restart after death
- Add a "Click to Start" image/button so the AR can get loaded and ready
- Make a platform generator component that keeps generating the level instead of hard-coding
